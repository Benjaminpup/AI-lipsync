# AI-lipsync
This project leverages state-of-the-art AI technology to generate realistic lipsync animations from audio. By using deep learning techniques, it synchronizes lip movements with spoken words, making it perfect for applications in animation, gaming, virtual avatars, and more.
Features:
Realistic Lipsync Generation: Generates lip movements based on the input audio to match the speech accurately.
Deep Learning Based: Utilizes neural networks for high-quality performance and accuracy.
Easy to Use: Designed to be easily integrated and used in a variety of applications.
Google Colab Integration: This project requires Google Colab to run. It is pre-configured for a seamless experience in Colab, with all necessary dependencies and environment settings in place.
Requirements:
Google Colab environment to execute the notebook and access GPU resources.
Audio file input for lipsync generation (supports various formats).
Getting Started:
Open the Google Colab notebook to run the project.
Upload your audio file.
Run the notebook cells to generate the lipsync animation.
Installation and Setup:
The entire setup is done automatically when running the Google Colab notebook, ensuring minimal hassle. Just follow the steps in the Colab file for a smooth process.
